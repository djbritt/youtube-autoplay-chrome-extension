# youtube-autoplay-chrome-extension

Either youtube likes to stop the auotplay feature on channels, or there are some broken videos, that autoplay doesn't work on, well, this fixed it for me.

This detects when a video is done, and clicks the next button for you.

This is somewhat finicky, because I have hard coded xpath's, but as for now it's working. January 2024
